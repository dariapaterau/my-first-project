  <p>If you are a six-year-old kid, who wants to learn the basics of <br>
      Karate or a sixty-year-old individual, who wants to acquire knowledge <br>
      of yoga and meditation, at every age learning is a part of our daily life. <br>
      It has no age bars and it defines the inner passion that is needed to be followed. <br>
      Non-Academic Learning plays an equal part in an individual's life. Be it trying your hands <br>
      on fitness and training, mastering the skills of check-mate moves, or pursuing your passion of <br>
      becoming a musician or a dancer, every extra-curricular activity has its own <br>
      advantages and it plays an imporatnt role in students' day-to-day lives. </p>

       indulge themselves in another way of learning outside their textbooks. They contribute to boosting<br>
      one's self-confidence and overall personal development. It is not necessary that it b<br>

      under non-academic learning, But, if anything that leads to enchanging your skills and <br>
      building your mind muscles, then they are known as Extracurricular Activities. </p>
